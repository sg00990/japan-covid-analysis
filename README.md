# Covid Cases in Japan (late 2022)

I used a dataset from Kaggle called [COVID-19 dataset in Japan](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lisphilar/covid19-dataset-in-japan) to analyze the areas in Japan experiencing the most cases. The file [japancases.py](japancases.py) is written in Python. I also used pandas, numpy and matplotlib. For data visualization, I created a bar graph and scatterplot that both display the total COVID-19 cases per prefecture.
